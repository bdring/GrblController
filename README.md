# GrblController
Demo of vb.net control of Grbl

The is a simple demo of control of the [Grbl CNC Machine Controller](https://github.com/grbl/grbl) using Visual Studio VB.Net.


The program uses a [GrblInterface Class](https://github.com/bdring/GrblController/blob/master/GrblController/GrblInterface.vb) to handle the serial protocol, file sending and regular status updates.

This make a GUI very simple.  It provides several events for the GUI to use.

The GUI that is part of this repo is only for demo purposes and should not be used to control a machine.

There is no compiled version or setup for this.  If you can't comile this yourself, you are not the target audience for this.
