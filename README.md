# GrblController
Demo of vb.net control of Grbl

The is a simple demo of control of the [Grbl CNC Machine Controller](https://github.com/grbl/grbl) using Visual Studio VB.Net.


The program uses a [GrblInterface Class](https://github.com/bdring/GrblController/blob/master/GrblController/GrblInterface.vb) to handle the serial protocol, file sending and regular status updates.

This make a GUI very simple.  It provides several events for the GUI to use.
